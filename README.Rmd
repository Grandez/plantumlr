The goal of plantumlr is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of plantumlr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("plantumlr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("grandez/plantumlr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(plantumlr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

## `template` package

### Generic template for research projects structured as R packages.

[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) documents are great to keep 
reproducible scientific workflows, tightly integrating code, results and text. I keep a collection of Rmarkdown templates (including some for writing scientific articles, or manuscript reviews) [here](https://github.com/Pakillo/rmdTemplates).

Once we are dealing with more complicated data analysis and writing custom code and functions for a research project, structuring our project as an [R package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) can bring many advantages (e.g. see [here](http://rmflight.github.io/post/analyses-as-packages/) and [here](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg), or read [Marwick et al.](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3192v2)). 

Hence this package works as a template for new research projects, with the idea of having everything (data, R scripts, functions and manuscripts reporting results) self-contained in the same package (a "research compendium") to facilitate collaboration and promote reproducibility.

A short presentation introducing this approach on 'Structuring data analysis projects as R packages' is available here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12479984.v1


### Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("devtools")
install_github("Pakillo/template")
```


### Usage

1. First, load the package

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("template")
```

2. Now run the function `new_project` to create a directory with all the scaffolding (slightly modified from R package structure). For example, to start a new project about tree growth, just use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
new_project("treegrowth")
```

If you want to create a GitHub repository for the project at the same time, use instead:

```{r eval=FALSE}
new_project("treegrowth", github = TRUE, private.repo = FALSE, travis = TRUE)
```

This will create a new folder with this structure:

Note that to create a GitHub repo you will need to have configured your system as explained in http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/functions/use_github. And for Travis to run you will need to activate it at https://travis-ci.org/profile.


### Developing the project

3. Now edit `README.Rmd` and the `DESCRIPTION` file with some basic information about your project: title, brief description, licence, package dependencies, etc. You may also check that project options in Rstudio are fine for you.

4. Place original (raw) data in `data-raw` folder. Save all R scripts used for data preparation in the same folder.

5. Save final (clean, tidy) datasets in the `data` folder. You may save them as plain text (txt, csv) or `rda` format (using `save`, `saveRDS` or `devtools::use_data`). You may write documentation for these data (see http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html#documenting-data). 

6. R scripts or Rmarkdown documents used for data analyses may be placed at the `analyses` folder. The final manuscript/report may be placed at the `manuscript` folder. You may want to use an Rmarkdown template from e.g. [rmdTemplates](https://github.com/Pakillo/rmdTemplates) or [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles). 

7. If your analyses use functions from other CRAN packages, include them as dependencies (`Imports`) in the `DESCRIPTION` file. Also use `Roxygen` `@import` or `@importFrom` in function definitions to import these dependencies in the namespace.

8. If you write custom functions, place them in the `R` folder. Document all your functions with `Roxygen` (see http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html). Write tests for your functions (see http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) and place them in the `tests` folder.

9. Write a `makefile` or master script to organise and execute all parts of the analysis. Render Rmarkdown reports using `rmarkdown::render`, and use Rstudio `Build` menu to create/update documentation, run tests, build package, etc.

10. Share.
